In this manuscript we have shown that the remarkable
Binomial identity~\eqref{prop:knuth-identity} given by Donald Knuth in
his fundamental work entitled
Concrete Mathematics is indeed true.
In addition, we provide a generalization for identity (5.42) for all $x$,
that is~\eqref{prop:generalized-knuths-identity}.
